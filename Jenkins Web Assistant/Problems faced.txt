Opening options in new tab.
	Spent ages trying to understand javascript to do it
	Eventually realised that it's just simple HTML.
	Means it's possible to set an internal system for the app however...
	NEW IDEA: Set internal website functionality. Redo certain pages with JavaCript instead of JSP

API
	No available documentation online
	May need to piece functionality together from other existing apps
	Might speak with Jesus and see if I can switch to something else

Saving options in Chrome
	Set up javascript and it seemed to be fine
	Problem unresolved, rewrote entire file and html file
	Not sure if problem was in .js or .html or both

Reading history from chrome
	modified sample code
	had problems returning the hostnames
		problem was with document.createElement("a");
		I had not used a, and created an invalid datatype
