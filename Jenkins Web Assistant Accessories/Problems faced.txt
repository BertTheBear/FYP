Opening options in new tab.
	Spent ages trying to understand javascript to do it
	Eventually realised that it's just simple HTML.
	Means it's possible to set an internal system for the app however...
	NEW IDEA: Set internal website functionality. Redo certain pages with JavaCript instead of JSP

API
	No available documentation online
	May need to piece functionality together from other existing apps
	Might speak with Jesus and see if I can switch to something else

Saving options in Chrome
	Set up javascript and it seemed to be fine
	Problem unresolved, rewrote entire file and html file
	Not sure if problem was in .js or .html or both
	PROBLEM
		Needed to place withing page load function

Variable Names
	Names were not very descriptive
	Changed names in order to support maintainability and exxtensibility.

Reading history from chrome
	modified sample code
	had problems returning the hostnames
		problem was with document.createElement("a");
		I had not used a, and created an invalid datatype


Opening in new tab from list in viewhistory
	Using window.onclick with href="#" caused errors if right-click open in new tab
	Eventually found method to just change the attribute
	Will probably be removed anyway but we'll see

Retrieving information from storage
	This was done after pager had loaded
	Had to manipulate and use Promise
		Still not perfect

Notifications
	Button not working
	Same happened with SAVE button
	PROBLEM
		Needed to place withing page load function
		Finally properly resolved this time
	SCREEN - doesn't work as well on multiple screens

Clear history
	Problems with object types
		cacheStorage and when removeFrom == 0
		Also had a few 
	Trigger when browser closed
	RESOLVED
	gets time of session on start
	clears from that time next time it's opened
		(Asked on Stack overflow for event handler)
	Notifications still showing after selected false
		After renaming variables notifications were still showing
		Removing code duplication to Background.js helped to discover this

Dynamic Schedule List
	Problems creating format
	Problems removing lines
	When switched to arrays problems modifying data and data types
		Removing entries
	Switched times and sites for faster processing
	NEW
	Deleting wrong element
		Cannot replicate on Windows

Variable types
	A few issues with variables that needed to have arbitrary actions performed
		eg var theString = aString + "";
	Increasing amount of soft-coding

Processing
	Urls with minor differences
	Wasn't removing certain urls
		Forgot to reduce index number to account for smaller array when removing items
	URL and visits
		For security reasons you can't process a list of both
		I might try again but it's not likely
			Using last visit for now
	Background
		Moved to Interface because of problems with background
	Duplicates
		Don't add to list if unverified example already exists
		Don't show notifications for auto schedules by default
			Caused trouble but got it done
	Turning off processing for short durations
		Difficult to do. Will leave to just using incognito

Reloading
	Saving page position on page reload

Tabs
	Retrieving tabs open with url

Code duplication
	Much of the code was duplicated or repeated between pages
	Problems with revisions and debugging and such
	SOLUTION
		Put functions in background page and called background page

Table size
	Very long URLs could extend the table too far
	This was resolved by putting "max-width: 400px; word-wrap: break-word;" in the css for the td
	This was tried on tr and table (And Div) before realising it needed to be the td
	This was pointed out by Owen.
